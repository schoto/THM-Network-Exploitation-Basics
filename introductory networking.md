<h3>OSI Model</h3>
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. 
In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; 
however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.

The OSI model consists of seven layers:

- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical

<h4>Layer 7 - Application:</h4>
The top layer, known as the Application layer, deals directly with programs and software. It provides a means for applications to communicate and send data. When data is handed over to this layer, it prepares it for transmission.

<h4>Layer 6 - Presentation:</h4>
The Presentation layer follows the Application layer. It takes data from the Application layer and ensures it's in a suitable format for both sending and receiving. Additionally, this layer handles tasks like encryption and compression.

<h4>Layer 5 - Session:</h4>
The Session layer focuses on establishing and maintaining connections between computers on a network. It checks if a connection can be made and then oversees the ongoing communication between the devices. It ensures data from different sources doesn't get mixed up during transmission.

<h4>Layer 4 - Transport:</h4>
The Transport layer plays a crucial role in choosing the appropriate protocol for data transmission. It can use either TCP or UDP, depending on the requirements. TCP ensures reliability, while UDP prioritizes speed. This layer also breaks data into manageable pieces for transmission.

<h4>Layer 3 - Network:</h4>
The Network layer determines the route for data to reach its destination, utilizing logical addressing (IP addresses) to guide it through the network. It is responsible for routing data through networks, using IP addresses for organization and sorting.

<h4>Layer 2 - Data Link:</h4>
The Data Link layer handles the physical addressing of data transmission. It adds the MAC address (unique physical address) of the receiving endpoint to the data packet. Additionally, it verifies the integrity of data to prevent corruption during transmission.

<h4>Layer 1 - Physical:</h4>
The Physical layer deals with the hardware aspect of networking. It's responsible for converting binary data into signals for transmission over the network. This layer also receives incoming signals and converts them back into binary data for processing.
