<h3>OSI Model</h3>
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. 
In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; 
however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.

The OSI model consists of seven layers:

- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical
