<h3>OSI Model</h3>
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. 
In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; 
however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.

The OSI model consists of seven layers:

- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical

<h4>Layer 7 - Application:</h4>
The top layer, known as the Application layer, deals directly with programs and software. It provides a means for applications to communicate and send data. When data is handed over to this layer, it prepares it for transmission.

<h4>Layer 6 - Presentation:</h4>
The Presentation layer follows the Application layer. It takes data from the Application layer and ensures it's in a suitable format for both sending and receiving. Additionally, this layer handles tasks like encryption and compression.

<h4>Layer 5 - Session:</h4>
The Session layer focuses on establishing and maintaining connections between computers on a network. It checks if a connection can be made and then oversees the ongoing communication between the devices. It ensures data from different sources doesn't get mixed up during transmission.

<h4>Layer 4 - Transport:</h4>
The Transport layer plays a crucial role in choosing the appropriate protocol for data transmission. It can use either TCP or UDP, depending on the requirements. TCP ensures reliability, while UDP prioritizes speed. This layer also breaks data into manageable pieces for transmission.

<h4>Layer 3 - Network:</h4>
The Network layer determines the route for data to reach its destination, utilizing logical addressing (IP addresses) to guide it through the network. It is responsible for routing data through networks, using IP addresses for organization and sorting.

<h4>Layer 2 - Data Link:</h4>
The Data Link layer handles the physical addressing of data transmission. It adds the MAC address (unique physical address) of the receiving endpoint to the data packet. Additionally, it verifies the integrity of data to prevent corruption during transmission.

<h4>Layer 1 - Physical:</h4>
The Physical layer deals with the hardware aspect of networking. It's responsible for converting binary data into signals for transmission over the network. This layer also receives incoming signals and converts them back into binary data for processing.

<br />
<br />
Encapsulation
<br />
<br />
As the data is passed down each layer of the model, more information containing details specific to the layer in question is added on to the start of the transmission. 
As an example, the header added by the Network Layer would include things like the source and destination IP addresses, and the header added by the Transport Layer would include (amongst other things) information specific to the protocol being used. 
The data link layer also adds a piece on at the end of the transmission, which is used to verify that the data has not been corrupted on transmission; this also has the added bonus of increased security, 
as the data can't be intercepted and tampered with without breaking the trailer. This whole process is referred to as encapsulation; the process by which data can be sent from one computer to another.

Notice that the encapsulated data is given a different name at different steps of the process. In layers 7,6 and 5, the data is simply referred to as data. 
In the transport layer the encapsulated data is referred to as a segment or a datagram (depending on whether TCP or UDP has been selected as a transmission protocol). 
At the Network Layer, the data is referred to as a packet. 
When the packet gets passed down to the Data Link layer it becomes a frame, and by the time it's transmitted across a network the frame has been broken down into bits.

When the message is received by the second computer, it reverses the process -- starting at the physical layer and working up until it reaches the application layer, stripping off the added information as it goes. 
This is referred to as de-encapsulation. As such you can think of the layers of the OSI model as existing inside every computer with network capabilities. 
Whilst it's not actually as clear cut in practice, computers all follow the same process of encapsulation to send data and de-encapsulation upon receiving it.

The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation are very important -- not least because of their practical use, but also because they give us a standardised method for sending data. 
This means that all transmissions will consistently follow the same methodology, allowing any network enabled device to send a request to any other reachable device and be sure that it will be understood -- 
regardless of whether they are from the same manufacturer; use the same operating system; or any other factors.

The TCP / IP Model
<br />
<br />

The TCP/IP model is, in many ways, very similar to the OSI model. It's a few years older, and serves as the basis for real-world networking. 
The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet and Network Interface. 
Between them, these cover the same range of functions as the seven layers of the OSI Model.

Note: Some recent sources split the TCP/IP model into five layers -- breaking the Network Interface layer into Data Link and Physical layers (as with the OSI model). 
This is accepted and well-known; however, it is not officially defined (unlike the original four layers which are defined in RFC1122). 
It's up to you which version you use -- both are generally considered valid.

You would be justified in asking why we bother with the OSI model if it's not actually used for anything in the real-world. 
The answer to that question is quite simply that the OSI model (due to being less condensed and more rigid than the TCP/IP model) tends to be easier for learning the initial theory of networking.

The two models match up something like this:

![image-3](https://github.com/schoto/THM-Network-Exploitation-Basics/assets/69323411/a2d6e6e1-744d-4f05-884c-8751429f280b)

The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation work in exactly the same way with the TCP/IP model as they do with the OSI model. 
At each layer of the TCP/IP model a header is added during encapsulation, and removed during de-encapsulation.

Now let's get down to the practical side of things.

A layered model is great as a visual aid -- it shows us the general process of how data can be encapsulated and sent across a network, but how does it actually happen?

When we talk about TCP/IP, it's all well and good to think about a table with four layers in it, but we're actually talking about a suite of protocols -- sets of rules that define how an action is to be carried out. 
TCP/IP takes its name from the two most important of these: the Transmission Control Protocol (which we touched upon earlier in the OSI model) that controls the flow of data between two endpoints, 
and the Internet Protocol, which controls how packets are addressed and sent. There are many more protocols that make up the TCP/IP suite; we will cover some of these in later tasks. For now though, let's talk about TCP.

As mentioned earlier, TCP is a connection-based protocol. In other words, before you send any data via TCP, you must first form a stable connection between the two computers. 
The process of forming this connection is called the three-way handshake.

When you attempt to make a connection, your computer first sends a special request to the remote server indicating that it wants to initialise a connection. 
This request contains something called a SYN (short for synchronise) bit, which essentially makes first contact in starting the connection process. 
The server will then respond with a packet containing the SYN bit, as well as another "acknowledgement" bit, called ACK. 
Finally, your computer will send a packet that contains the ACK bit by itself, confirming that the connection has been setup successfully. With the three-way handshake successfully completed, 
data can be reliably transmitted between the two computers. Any data that is lost or corrupted on transmission is re-sent, thus leading to a connection which appears to be lossless.

<br />
<br />
Ping
<br />
<br />

The ```ping``` is used to check if the connection works for an IP address.

For example we can check if we have connection with google.com. We do it by this command
```
ping google.com
```

The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible. 
Usually this will be a website on the internet, but it could also be for a computer on your home network if you want to check if it's configured correctly. 
Ping works using the ICMP protocol, which is one of the slightly less well-known TCP/IP protocols that were mentioned earlier. 
The ICMP protocol works on the Network layer of the OSI Model, and thus the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model. The basic syntax for ping is ```ping <target>```.

<br />
<br />
Traceroute
<br />
<br />

The logical follow-up to the ping command is 'traceroute'. Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.

The internet is made up of many, many different servers and end-points, all networked up to each other. This means that, in order to get to the content you actually want, you first need to go through a bunch of other servers. 
Traceroute allows you to see each of these connections -- it allows you to see every intermediate step between your computer and the resource that you requested. The basic syntax for traceroute on Linux is this: ```traceroute <destination>```

By default, the Windows traceroute utility (```tracert```) operates using the same ICMP protocol that ping utilises, and the Unix equivalent operates over UDP. This can be altered with switches in both instances.

WHOIS
<br />
<br />

Domain Names -- the unsung saviours of the internet.

Can you imagine how it would feel to remember the IP address of every website you want to visit? Horrible thought.

Fortunately, we've got domains.

We'll talk a little bit more about how this works in the next task, but for now suffice to know that a domain translates into an IP address so that we don't need to remember it 
(e.g. you can type tryhackme.com, rather than the TryHackMe IP address). Domains are leased out by companies called Domain Registrars. 
If you want a domain, you go and register with a registrar, then lease the domain for a certain length of time.

![image-16](https://github.com/schoto/THM-Network-Exploitation-Basics/assets/69323411/35713151-38a8-4ed0-9689-33e6477ff7fc)

We talked about domains in the previous task -- now lets talk about how they work.

Ever wondered how a URL gets converted into an IP address that your computer can understand? The answer is a TCP/IP protocol called DNS (Domain Name System).

At the most basic level, DNS allows us to ask a special server to give us the IP address of the website we're trying to access. 
For example, if we made a request to www.google.com, our computer would first send a request to a special DNS server (which your computer already knows how to find). 
The server would then go looking for the IP address for Google and send it back to us. Our computer could then send the request to the IP of the Google server.

Let's break this down a bit.

You make a request to a website. The first thing that your computer does is check its local cache to see if it's already got an IP address stored for the website; if it does, great. 
If not, it goes to the next stage of the process.

Assuming the address hasn't already been found, your computer will then send a request to what's known as a recursive DNS server. 
These will automatically be known to the router on your network. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) maintain their own recursive servers, but companies such as Google and OpenDNS also control recursive servers. 
This is how your computer automatically knows where to send the request for information: details for a recursive DNS server are stored in your router. 
This server will also maintain a cache of results for popular domains; however, if the website you've requested isn't stored in the cache, the recursive server will pass the request on to a root name server.

Before 2004 there were precisely 13 root name DNS servers in the world. 
These days there are many more; however, they are still accessible using the same 13 IP addresses assigned to the original servers (balanced so that you get the closest server when you make a request). 
The root name servers essentially keep track of the DNS servers in the next level down, choosing an appropriate one to redirect your request to. 
These lower level servers are called Top-Level Domain servers.

Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers are split up into extensions. So, for example, if you were searching for tryhackme.com your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handled ```.com``` domains. 
If you were searching for ```bbc.co.uk``` your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handles .co.uk domains. 
As with root name servers, TLD servers keep track of the next level down: Authoritative name servers. 
When a TLD server receives your request for information, the server passes it down to an appropriate Authoritative name server.

Authoritative name servers are used to store DNS records for domains directly. 
In other words, every domain in the world will have its DNS records stored on an Authoritative name server somewhere or another; they are the source of the information. 
When your request reaches the authoritative name server for the domain you're querying, it will send the relevant information back to you, allowing your computer to connect to the IP address behind the domain you requested.

When you visit a website in your web browser this all happens automatically, 
but we can also do it manually with a tool called ```dig``` . Like ```ping``` and ```traceroute```, dig should be installed automatically on Linux systems.

Dig allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains:
```dig <domain> @<dns-server-ip>```

It is a very useful tool for network troubleshooting.

![dig-demo](https://github.com/schoto/THM-Network-Exploitation-Basics/assets/69323411/bfcf8896-b1a2-4502-be4a-7b1da0e8df02)

This is a lot of information. We're currently most interested in the ```ANSWER``` section for this room; however, taking the time to learn what the rest of this means is a very good idea. 
In summary, that information is telling us that we sent it one query and successfully (i.e. No Errors) received one full answer -- which, as expected, contains the IP address for the domain name that we queried.

Another interesting piece of information that dig gives us is the TTL (Time To Live) of the queried DNS record. As mentioned previously, when your computer queries a domain name, it stores the results in its local cache. 
The TTL of the record tells your computer when to stop considering the record as being valid -- i.e. when it should request the data again, rather than relying on the cached copy.

The TTL can be found in the second column of the answer section:

![TTL](https://github.com/schoto/THM-Network-Exploitation-Basics/assets/69323411/c1407a3e-e28c-4cb5-abcd-f190eba18e77)

It's important to remember that TTL (in the context of DNS caching) is measured in seconds, so the record in the example will expire in two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.
